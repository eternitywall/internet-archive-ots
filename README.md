# Timestamping the Internet

The OpenTimestamps team has timestamped every item in the Internet Archive -
about 750,000,000 files in total - and made those timestamps publically
available via a [searchable
database](https://opentimestamps.org/internet-archive/). This means that right
now you can get timestamps for every book, movie, song, computer program, legal
document, etc. in the thousands of collections in the archive. In the future we
hope to be able to work with the Internet Archive to extend this to
timestamping website snapshots. We're setting up infrastructure to continue
timestamping new items as they're uploaded to the archive.



### Run the Application

We have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server. The simplest way to start
this server is:

```
npm start
```

Now browse to the app at [`localhost:8000/index.html`][local-app-url].
